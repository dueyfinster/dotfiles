# TODO (in no particular order)

* Fix shortcuts ctrl-j ctrl-k in neovim
* Fix shortcuts under <leader>v as I have nvim commands but lsp ones overlap
* Remove old vim files
* perhaps do install script that links stow?!?
* Remove unused scripts from bin/
* Fix ripgrep to always search hidden

## Linux specific
* Use i3 again to modernize config - try to create "hyper" key
* Try i3 config with sway/wayland

## Mac specific
* Work/Personal brew installs
* Update brew file to currently used packages

## Future considerations
* Use newer aliases? eza? fd? bat? (need to check if installed)
* Nix to install??
