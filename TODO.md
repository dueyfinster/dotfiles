# TODO (in no particular order)

* Fix shortcuts ctrl-j ctrl-k in neovim
* Fix shortcuts under <leader>v as I have nvim commands but lsp ones overlap
* Remove old vim files
* perhaps do install script that links stow?!?
* Remove unused scripts from bin/

## Linux specific 
* Use i3 again to modernize config - try to create "hyper" key
* Try i3 config with sway/wayland

## Mac specific
* Work/Personal brew installs
* Update brew file to currently used packages
 
## Future considerations
* Nix to install??
